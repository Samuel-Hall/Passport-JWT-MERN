# Dialectic

The dialectical method, is at base a discourse between two or more people holding different points of view about a subject but wishing to establish the truth through reasoned arguments.

###Dialectic is a project management application for student organizations and/or small business that serves two purposes:

- Allows members of an organization to collaborate on projects and communicate amongst teams in order to achieve success.
- Communicate to the public about any upcoming events, projects, products, updates, or general outreach.

The initial view of this application, the public view, displays the organization's logo along with all published posts ordered by recency. Anyone is allowed to view this content. This serves as the point of contact to the public for the organization.

The private view, which requires authentication, is only viewable by members of the organization. This view contains two main sections:

- Users
- Projects

####Users

The initial administrator user is created upon first login. The app checks to see if any users exist in the database, if not, it allows only the initial user to be created from the public view. From here, only authenticated users can create new users.
The first task on the user view is to create new users. Once the new user logs in, they can go to the second task which allows them to update their user data so long as they have the correct password.

####Projects

Authenticated users can create projects which contain a task board, discussion forum, and post editor, and then assign the appropriate amount of total funds alotted for the project.
The tasks board allows groups to break down large projects into smaller chunks and distribute funds to each task.
The discussion forum allows all users to have a centralized portal for communication about each project. All users can update the project with who's doing what, set time expectations, or even ask general questions or clarification.
From the post editor, users can create the public facing content as the projects move along. This allows the organization to interface with their audience as progress is made.
